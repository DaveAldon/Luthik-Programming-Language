# Luthik-Programming-Language

Luthik is a new interpreted programming language I am working on, and this project serves several purposes:

1. To better understand how interpreted and compiled languages operate
2. To learn how to write scripts in Swift
3. To create a programming language!

To run the project in its current state, Luthik assumes the following:

1. You have the ability to compile Swift scripts on a Mac OS via "swiftc" or other means
2. You have a Luthik source file called "luthiksyntax.luthik" located in your Documents folder.
